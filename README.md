# Foundational and adjacent skills in Data Egineering

This repo was motivated by the post [How I build learning projects](https://medium.com/@rchang/how-i-build-learning-projects-part-i-54dbaad68961) written by Robert Chang, the intention of this repo is to provide with a list of skills and resources that a sofware engineer could use to learn the foundational skills to transfition to a data engineering career.
